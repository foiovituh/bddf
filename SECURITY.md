## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in BakPak, please report it responsibly by sending an email to foiovituh@outlook.com.

We aim to respond within 5â€“30 business days with an initial acknowledgment and, if applicable, follow up with updates as we investigate and address the issue.

If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to release a patch as soon as possible and credit the reporter unless they request otherwise. If the report is not accepted, we will explain the reasoning.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have addressed it or agreed on a disclosure timeline.
